Logger.NET is a powerful and efficient logging framework for C# applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to log messages, track performance metrics, and manage log files.

## Features

- **Log messages with different severity levels:** ``Debug, Info, Warning, Error``
- **Automatic capture of calling class and method information:** ``Each log entry includes information about the calling class and method.``
- **High-performance logging:** ``Log entries are stored in a concurrent queue for high throughput.``
- **JSON log files:** ``Entries are written to JSON files for easy parsing and analysis.``
- **Log file rotation:** ``Rotate log files based on a configurable time interval (e.g., every 24 hours).``
- **Log file purging:** ``Delete log files based on a configurable file age (e.g., delete files older than 30 days).``
- **Log statistics tracking:** ``Retrieve statistics such as total logs logged, logs logged in the last 24 hours, functions timed, and total function execution time.``
- **Function timing:** ``Time the execution of synchronous and asynchronous functions.``
- **Optimized for performance:** ``Designed to handle high-performance logging scenarios efficiently.``
